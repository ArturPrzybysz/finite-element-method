"""
a) Write a Matlab routine that constructs an array for holding information about boundary
edges (beds) of the triangular mesh. (HINT: the use of a distance function fd can make the
job of finding nodes that belong to a boundary implicitly defined by the distance function
very easy. Below it is included in the argument list as an optional argument. top is a
tolerance to be used with the signed distance function to tune the selection of nodes.)

Hint: Check slide 30 in lecture 4 on Mesh Generation. Signed distance functions are available in the DistMesh package
